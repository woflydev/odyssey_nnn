# Project Odyssey 2023: REDEMPTION AT LAST! (Odyssey NNN)

Our hard work finally paid off, as we were crowned the **Best Overall** and **1st Place** champions of the Droid Racing Challenge 2023! Thank you so much to the [QUT Robotics Club](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cu9Vgmuro8u/?img_index=1) for hosting such an awesome event and for allowing us to attend!

However, we didn't end up using this implementation on the day, due to some small bugs. Check [woflydev/odyssey_lsd](https://github.com/woflydev/odyssey_lsd) for the competition version.
